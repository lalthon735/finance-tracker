## How it works?

<p>The app features four primary sections. Let's take a brief look at each one to give you an overview of their functions.</p>

<h2>Home Page</h2>

<h4>1. Expenses</h4> 
<p>This section displays your product categories and past expenses, along with your total monthly spending. Selecting a category shows all related expenses in the PREVIOUS EXPENSES area.</p>
<h6>How can I modify or remove a specific category?</h6>
<p>In the PREVIOUS EXPENSES section, expenses appear as cards. Tapping a card allows you to edit the details of that specific item.</p>

</div>

<h4>2. Pie Chart</h4> 
<p>This straightforward component presents a detailed pie chart of your expenses by category. Clicking on a category name below highlights its corresponding slice in the chart. The pie chart also displays percentage breakdowns, helping you identify which categories consume more of your budget.</p>

<h4>3. Add Page</h4> 
<p>This is the core feature of our app: bill scanning capability.</p>
<h6>Need to add just a few items without a bill?</h6>
<p>We've included a convenient form below the "Scan your Bill" button for manual product entry.</p>
